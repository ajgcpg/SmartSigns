# SmartSigns
Smart stop signs.
- At 2/3/4-way intersections: signals on each sign to show other car positions / who's turn it is to go / how much time to wait
- At intersections where oncoming traffic does not stop: tells drivers speed of incoming cars and how much time is left until oncoming cars reach intersection
